 *First Task Completed: Iris Flower Classification with Deep Learning at Bharat Intern* 

I am thrilled to share that I've successfully completed my first task as an intern at Bharat Intern! The project focused on the classification of iris flowers using deep learning techniques—a foundational yet insightful challenge in the field of machine learning.

### 🔍 *Project Overview:*
The primary goal of this project was to accurately classify iris flowers into their respective species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—based on various features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

### 📊 *Exploratory Data Analysis:*
I began with a thorough exploratory analysis using *NumPy, **Pandas, **Seaborn, and **Matplotlib*. This step was crucial for understanding the dataset's underlying patterns and relationships. Visualizing these relationships allowed me to spot any potential anomalies and gain insights into feature correlations.

### 🧠 *Model Development:*
Leveraging the power of *Keras* and *Scikit-learn (sklearn)*, I developed a deep learning model tailored for this classification task. The dataset was split into training and testing subsets, ensuring that the model's performance could be accurately evaluated.

### 🔥 *Key Achievements:*
- *Heatmap Creation:* A heatmap was generated to visualize the correlation between different features, highlighting the most influential attributes for classification.
- *Model Training & Testing:* The model was trained on the dataset, and rigorous testing was conducted to assess its accuracy.
- *Confusion Matrix:* I created a confusion matrix to further analyze the model's performance, identifying how well it distinguishes between different classes.
- *Accuracy Plotting:* Finally, I plotted the accuracy to visualize the model’s effectiveness and track its learning progress over epochs.

### 🚀 *Outcomes:*
The results were impressive, with the model achieving a high level of accuracy in classifying the iris species. This experience not only honed my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of machine learning and its practical applications.

I'm excited to continue learning and contributing to more projects during my internship at Bharat Intern. A big thank you to the team for their support and guidance!
